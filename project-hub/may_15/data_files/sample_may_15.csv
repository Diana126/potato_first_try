id,textitem_1,"MICHAEL HUSKIN: [04:35:17] All right. Hello. My name is Michael Huskin. I am a policy associate at the Southern Center for Human Rights. We are seeing here today in terms of turnout and excitement and energy and passion and vigor is astounding in some ways but it's not surprising. And it's not surprising because we've been doing this for a long time. You've been hearing from us for a long time. This has been going on for two years, two years now. And some of you weren't even on this council when it was first voted on. And we understand that, and we're excited for you to have the opportunity to stand against it when the time for the vote comes. I want to start by being honest about some of the forces that do support Cop City in this city. It's certainly not any of the people who have shown up time and again to speak against it. No one who comes down to City Hall. It's people like the Atlanta Police Foundation and their CEO, Dave Wilkinson, who we know wields an enormous amount of power in Atlanta. It's a powerful corporations behind the Atlanta Committee for Progress. It's Coca-Cola and much of the money that gets funneled through their foundations. It's Home Depot, UPS, Waffle House, JP Morgan, Delta, Chick-Fil-A, Amazon, the many corporations that support the Police Foundation. There's Cox Enterprises, which owns the AJC, which has donated $10 million through its foundation to Cop City. And of course, there's Brian Kemp, the governor, who so many of you so consistently denounce, who has vocally supported Cop City and who you are siding with when you support Cop City. So that's who supports it. And that does not sound representative of Atlanta or our very diverse communities to me. And I know it doesn't sound representative of Atlanta to you. And so let's talk about the other side of the issue, who opposes Cop City. And we're going to start with some history. So Cop City was first announced in the spring of 2021 by Mayor Keisha Lance bottoms. Community members and organizers immediately began knocking doors, educating their community members, building opposition. And as the legislation came before the city council committees in the summer of 2021, this body heard time and again hours and hours and hours of public comment. In June of 2021, Dave Wilkinson of the Atlanta Police Foundation knew that it was at risk because there was so much opposition and according to an open records request email that we got, we saw an email that he sent to the mayor's staff saying, we know that council members are looking, ''for a cover to vote for this'' because they know the people don't support it. And he said, and I'm forging you this email from a CEO who lives in Buckhead, who's on the Atlanta Committee for progress. And this CEO is saying, hey, if you don't support Cop City, we're going to join the secession movement. That, again, is the force behind Cop City. It's not the people. The people have continually shown up against it. In August of 2021, due to so much opposition, Cop City was delayed for about a month again because of the failure of the Atlanta Police Foundation or the city to engage with the community in any real way. When it came before the committee again or before the full council in September 2021, you heard 17 hours of public comment. The vast majority of it was against, and you voted for it anyway. Now, over the past two years, I just want to name some of the many ways that you've seen community members engage, because you cannot deny that, yes, there are people from all over the world who support the Stop Cop City movement. That is true and it should be true because it impacts people all over the world. But this is a homegrown movement. This came from Atlanta. This came from Southeast Atlanta. That's what you've heard so many people here today say, I live in Southeast Atlanta. I live right around the forest. The people who called in the fall of 2021, they all said they were from Buckhead. They don't want to build in their neighborhood. And everybody from this area is saying, don't build it. Everyone across Atlanta, except for Buckhead is saying, don't build it. A couple of those groups, the East Atlanta Community Association, the Grant Park Neighborhood Association, the South Atlanta's for Neighborhood Development, Kirkwood Neighborhoods Association. Some of the most esteemed civil and human rights organizations in the city and in the country have come out against it. Let me name a few, because all of you like to name them a lot of the time. And so listen to them now, MWCPA of Georgia, New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter, Southern Center for Human Rights, Community Movement Builders, Movement for Black Lives, Human Rights Watch, Asian-American Advocacy Fund, ACLU of Georgia, Southern Poverty Law Center, Law for Black Lives, Sierra Club, 350.org, Faculty and Students from Universities, Georgia Tech, GSU, Emory. I'm sure I'm missing something, Spelman, Morehouse have all put out statements. They've all protested. They've said, don't do this. A delegation came from Muskogee Nation during the week of action to say, do not build Cop City on stolen land. Bernice King, the daughter of MLK, who some of you just uttered his name, has written in the AJC saying, do not build Cop City in this place. Do a different plan. Bernice King. What I said right here is a fraction of the opposition, a fraction. It's been two years and you all know it. So if you do decide to vote for $33.5 million in funding, know that you are not standing with the community. You're not. These are the people. You can choose to listen to them. You can choose to listen to the powerful corporations, the people with deep pockets. But know what you're doing and know that none of you will get a pass for it. I also want to say so many of you have decried what you say is violence from protesters. You can feel however you want to feel about it. Know that when you tell people to use formal channels of engagement, and then we do, and we give you 17 hours of public comment. We have 300 people who signed up today, and then 100 more who weren't allowed to sign up. We are using the formal channels of engagement. I've talked to reporters who have said they have never seen. They've covered City Hall for years, decades, never seen this many people show up. Never. I'm sure those of you who are no, those of you who have been here for a long time, you've never seen this sort of turnout. I haven't heard one person speak in favor of Cop City. Maybe we can tie like that. This doesn't need to go on any longer. It doesn't. You can stop it. You can be brave. You can stand up to the Atlanta Police Foundation. Someone said before, APF is trying to make villains of you. Don't let them. Don't let Andre Dickens, don't let APF make a villain of you. Stand with the people. Know that you can vote against Cop City. We know it's not being voted on today, but we know that before you get into the room for the vote, those votes are decided. So here we are telling you when we can make a difference. Stop Cop City. Don't support this funding. Thank you. [04:41:23]"
