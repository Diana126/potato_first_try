id,textitem_1,"REV. YEARWOOD: [04:16:46] Thank you so much. My name is Reverend Yearwood. I am the President of the Hip Hop Caucus. In this process, as president of the largest hip hop political organization in the world, I've had a chance to talk with both sides. I've talked with those from the community, movement builders. I've talked with activists like Yonajaha. I've talked with forest defenders. And we've had conversations with the mayor's office. We've looked at this issue extensively. We've looked at all angles. So, I had the opportunity to sit exactly where you are as the president of the Hip Hop Caucus, with that responsibility of what that means. And I can come to you, and hopefully you will come to the same conclusion. Hip Hop Caucus has said no to Cop City. [04:17:42]"item_2,[04:17:44] [clapping]. [04:17:44]item_3,"I am also an environmentalist. Was very blessed to be named by this country, the United States of America, in 2015 as a climate hero. And in that process, being called a climate hero, I also wanted to be here because part of my role was to be in Egypt at the climate conference last year, and I will be in Dubai at the climate conference this year. Was in Scotland the year before. But you are making my job much harder because it will be very hard for me to tell the world to be clear on climate justice when we are here in Atlanta and we don't put forth racial justice. It will be very hard for me to go to the world to explain to them that we understand the climate crisis that we are in. That we understand what we are dealing with.

It is very hard for that. And with all due respect, I knew your father quite well. And I know this because in 2013, outside the White House. Me and him, as two Black activists, made a decision to get arrested outside the White House when President Obama was president. And we made that decision. We linked arms together outside the White House. That was the last time that he was arrested for anything. And when he was arrested, he was arrested for climate justice. And I went to jail with him. And I sat next to him in a jail cell. And I can tell you this, I can't say what he would do, obviously, but I can tell you that he would understand that this is our Lunch Counter moment for the 21st century.

And on World Environment Day, they are watching you, your decision. And let me say this on this June 5th of 2023. A hundred years from now, on June 5th, 2123, many of us in this room will be here, but we will decide if we have some broken down relic that was called Cop City, or we will have clean air and clean water. That your decision today. [04:20:30]"item_7,AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [04:20:30] [cheering]. [04:20:30]item_8,"REV. YEARWOOD: [04:20:33] Stop Cop City. Stop Cop city. Stop Cop City. Make the right decision today. I know you well. I know you can. And all power, the people understand. [04:20:45]"item_9,AUDIENCE MEMBERS: [04:20:46] [cheering]. [04:20:46]item_10,"DOUG SHIPMAN: [04:20:46] Time has expired. Next up will be Mark Thompson. Just a note before you start, Mr. Thompson. I've been told that some of the elevators are broken. We are working on those. They've not been shut down. They're actually not working. I don't know why. I've just been informed of that. So we're trying to get those fixed. You have up to two minutes.
